Once you've installed Subtrace and you've signed in to the [dashboard](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard), you can view
all the requests flowing through your app.

Often you'll want to narrow down the set of requests to a particular time range. You can do this by
using the **request graph** at the top of the page. In the graph, time flows from left to right. Every blue bar
represents a certain interval of time (indicated by the granularity setting just below the graph), and its height
indicates the relative number of requests that were traced during that interval. 

### Selecting a time range
You can drag/pan across the graph to select the interval you're interested in:

<video width="100%" height="100%" controls>
  <source src="request_graph_drag_pan.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

Notice that the DevTools pane below reacts to the time ranges changing.

You can also interact with this graph in other ways. For example, by selecting a range and clicking on "zoom", you can
see the same data at a finer granularity. By clicking on a blue bar, you can zoom in on just that interval:

<video width="100%" height="100%" controls>
  <source src="request_graph_zoom.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

See [here](/adding-filter-clauses) if you're looking to filter requests based on properties other than their timestamp.
