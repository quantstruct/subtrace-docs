1. Go to [subtrace.dev/dashboard/tokens](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard/tokens) and log in with your single sign-on (SSO) identity provider.

2. Click **Create API token** to generate a Subtrace API token for your namespace.

3. Install Subtrace and start your app under Subtrace to automatically trace requests. Again, don't forget to set the `SUBTRACE_TOKEN` environment variable.

```bash
export SUBTRACE_TOKEN=
curl -fsSL https://subtrace.dev/install.sh | sh
subtrace run -- node ./server.js
```

Congratulations! Your app is now running under Subtrace. Send a HTTP request to
your app and you should see it automatically appear in the Subtrace dashboard.

While this is sufficient to get started with Subtrace, you should install
Subtrace everywhere in your infrastructure to get the most out of it. Pick the
one that matches your situation best to learn more:
