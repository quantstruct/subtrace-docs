## Signing up to use Subtrace

1. Go to [https://subtrace.dev/login](https://subtrace.dev/login) and log in with your single sign-on (SSO) identity provider.

2. If this is your first time using Subtrace, you will be instructed to create your first namespace.

Once this is done, you should see the Subtrace dashboard. There's nothing there yet, so the next step is to ingest some traces.

## Setting up a Subtrace worker

The worker is where all your tracing data lives. You can set one up on any machine that's connected to the internet.

1. Go to the [Subtrace dashboard](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard/) and click on "Tokens" in the left pane.

2. Click **Create worker token** to generate a Subtrace worker token. 

3. Run the Subtrace worker docker image. Don't forget to set the `SUBTRACE_TOKEN` environment variable to the token you just generated.

```bash
docker run -d --env SUBTRACE_TOKEN='subt_...' ghcr.io/subtrace/worker:latest
```

This sets up a worker that listens for your app's traces.

## Running your app under Subtrace

1. Go to the [Subtrace dashboard](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard/) and click on "Tokens" in the left pane.

2. Click **Create tracer token** to generate a Subtrace tracer token. 

3. Install Subtrace and start your app under Subtrace to automatically trace requests. Again, don't forget to set the `SUBTRACE_TOKEN` environment variable to the token you just generated.

```bash
export SUBTRACE_TOKEN=subt_...
curl -fsSL https://subtrace.dev/install.sh | sh
subtrace run -- node ./server.js
```

Congratulations! Your app is now running under Subtrace. Send a HTTP request to
your app and you should see it automatically appear in the [Subtrace dashboard](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard/).

While this is sufficient to get started with Subtrace, you should install
Subtrace everywhere in your infrastructure to get the most out of it. Pick the
one that matches your situation best to learn more:
