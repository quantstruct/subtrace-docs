## Basic filtering
You can filter your app's requests based on properties like request path, request method, response status code, and many
more. These filters are expressed using the syntax of SQL WHERE clauses. Here's an example of filtering requests that
have a 5XX status code by using the filter `http_resp_status_code LIKE '5%'`: 

<video width="100%" height="100%" controls>
  <source src="filter_clause_add.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

See [here](#recognized-properties) for the list of properties you can filter on with Subtrace out of the box.

## Autocompletion

Notice that in the video above, we didn't type out the entire name `http_resp_status_code`. We were able to type just a
section of it, and use the `⇥ Tab` key to autocomplete the name. This works similarly to shells like bash or zsh.

When we detect that an autocomplete suggestion is available, it will be displayed next to the current word being typed.
 If there are multiple available suggestions, you can choose among them using the `↑` and `↓` arrow keys.

## Recognized properties

These are the properties that Subtrace recognizes for filters. But that doesn't mean these are the _only_
properties you can filter on. You can add some additional information to your request/response headers to allow you to
filter on custom properties.
